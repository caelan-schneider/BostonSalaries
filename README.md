# BostonSalaries 
Welcome to my project! This interactive web app allows users to query data and see interesting visualizations about Boston City Employee pay, with the goal of promoting transparency.

It's built on Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, JavaScript, D3.js, HTML, and MongoDB.
Data is sourced from Boston's Open Data Portal: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report

Link to the production app (hosted on MongoDB Atlas and Heroku): https://city-employee-salaries.herokuapp.com/
